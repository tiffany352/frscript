## FRScript

One day I decided to write a scripting language based on S-exprs with type checking and FRP functionality and a syntax frontend to avoid parens. Very early stage, will probaby be rewritten in another language eventually

## Usage

You can `require 'frscript'` and execute scripts using that, or you can start an interactive interpreter with:

    $ lua -e "require('frscript').context().interactive()"
